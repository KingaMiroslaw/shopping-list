# About The App

The Shopping List project was created by me, while learning [React](https://reactjs.org/). The project was based on my own idea and the current state of knowledge. It is a simple application used to create a shopping list. My main goal during this project was to practice the basic functionalities of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) and practice working with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Features:
- Add products to the list
- Remove a single product from the list
- Remove all products from the list
- Editing a product in the list
